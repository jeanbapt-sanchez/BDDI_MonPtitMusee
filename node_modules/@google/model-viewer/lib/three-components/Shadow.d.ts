 * as the shadow and model are both parented to the same object (call it the
 * scene) and this scene is passed as the target parameter to the shadow's
 * constructor. We also must constrain the scene to motion within the horizontal
 * plane and call the setRotation() method whenever the model's Y-axis rotation
 * changes. For motion outside of the horizontal plane, this.needsUpdate must be
 * set to true.
 *
 * The softness of the shadow is controlled by changing its resolution, making
 * softer shadows faster, but less precise.

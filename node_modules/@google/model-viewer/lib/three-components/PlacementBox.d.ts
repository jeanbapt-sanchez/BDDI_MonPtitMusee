 * This class is a set of two coincident planes. The first is just a cute box
 * outline with rounded corners and damped opacity to indicate the floor extents
 * of a model. It is purposely larger than the model's bounding box by RADIUS on
 * all sides so that small models are still visible / selectable. Its center is
 * actually carved out by vertices to ensure its fragment shader doesn't add
 * much time.
 *
 * The child plane is a simple plane with the same extents for use in hit
 * testing (translation is triggered when the touch hits the plane, rotation
 * otherwise).
